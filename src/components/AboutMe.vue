          <h1>The Beginning...</h1>
          <p>I love computers and everything to do with technology. Guess what? That love all started with a
          single Windows 95 video game my mom purchased for me. Even though we did not own a computer at the time
          she began the search of buying a used one from the local classifieds in the newspaper. She found a cheap one,
           bought it and got it all setup back at home. We proceeded to install the game with no luck. Hours of trying out
          different commands became my very first troubleshooting experience. With no luck, we brought the computer to
          the local computer shop only to find out that the computer was not a Windows 95 computer, but MS-DOS. Even though
          I was not able to play that video game, the process of learning through trial and error was something I fell
          in love with. Now, just a few months from finishing my diploma in Computer Systems Technology, I'm excited
          for what the future holds for me and the new technologies I still want to learn.</p>

            mobile applications, and web development. I'm currently learning more about Game Development, VR
            Development and hope to get involved in these areas in the near future.</p>
